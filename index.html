<p> BASIC ELEMENTS OF A COMPUTER: A computer consists of </p> 

<ul> 
 <li>processor </li>
<li> memory, </li>
<li> I/O components </li>
<li> system bus. </li>

Processor: It Controls the operation of the computer and performs its data processing functions. When there is only one processor, it is often referred to as the central processing unit.

Main memory: It Stores data and programs. This memory is typically volatile; that is, when the computer is shut down, the contents of the memory are lost. Main memory is also referred to as real memory or primary memory.

I/O modules: It moves data between the computer and its external environment. The external environment consists of a variety of devices, including secondary memory devices (e. g., disks), communications equipment, and terminals.

System bus: It provides the communication among processors, main memory, and I/O modules.
